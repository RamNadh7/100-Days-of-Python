FAQ: Why does choice B always become choice A in every round, even when A had more followers? 

Suppose you just started the game and you are comparing the followers of A - Instagram (364k) to B - Selena Gomez (174k). Instagram has more followers, so choice A is correct. However, the subsequent comparison should be between Selena Gomez (the new A) and someone else. The reason is that everything in our list has fewer followers than Instagram. If we were to keep Instagram as part of the comparison (as choice A) then Instagram would stay there for the rest of the game. This would be quite boring. By swapping choice B for A each round, we avoid a situation where the number of followers of choice A keeps going up over the course of the game. Hope that makes sense :-)
